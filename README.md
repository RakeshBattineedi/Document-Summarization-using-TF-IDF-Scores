# Document-Summarization-using-TF-IDF-Scores

Objectives
The goal of this project is to enable you to gain experience in:

· Creating an authorship identification system based on the similarity of the author’s attributes

· Calculating TF/IDF scores using MapReduce

· Document summarization using MapReduce

1. Introduction

The goal of this project is to take a given document, and extract sentences that best summarize the
document. We will calculate the level of importance for each sentence using TF-IDF (Term Frequency Inverse
Document Frequency).

2. Software Requirements


(1) calculate the TF, IDF, and TF-IDF values for all terms for all sub-collections in this corpus.

(2) Create the summaries of articles (Use 1G data files).

(3) Store the results in a HDFS file.

(4) For a given article software should be able to generate a summary.
